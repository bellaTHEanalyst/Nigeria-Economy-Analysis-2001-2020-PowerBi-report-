## Introduction

 This is a  data visualization and data storytelling project. I helped a friend create a powerBi report on Nigeriaâ€™s Economic data from 2001-2020 and make sense out of the visuals by interpreting each of them. This dataset was gotten from the world bank.
 
## Problem statement 

What are the rural population, urban population, and population rate by year?

What is the GDP (Current US $) and GNI (Current US $) by year?

What is the fertility rate, total (births per woman) by year?


What is the relationship between the Import of goods (Current US $) and the Export of Goods (current US $)?

What is the percentage of trade (% of GDP), agriculture, forestry, and fishing, and value-added (% of GDP) for the year 2011?

## Data Cleaning / Transformation

Data cleaning and transformation was done by my friend using

- Using excel formulas and functions

- Creating   PivotTables

## SKILLS/CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED

- PowerBi

- Data storytelling

## Analysis 2

Gross domestic product (GDP) is the most commonly used measure for the size of an economy and Gross national income (GNI) is defined as a gross domestic product, plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income, and net taxes fewer subsidies on production.

 GDP refers to the income generated by production activities on the economic territory of the country and GNI measures the income generated by the residents of a country, whether earned in the domestic territory or abroad.
